why SC not reported here in engauged data?
available in author table data if needed
=> SC actually indirectly measured = should not be considered as validation data = lines removed

this dataset could be used to assess the error between Engauge and author table data

+anteroposterior is actually +posteroanterior
= check in all datasets
